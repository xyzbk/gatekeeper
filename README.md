# Gatekeeper

> The code was correct. The decision was wrong. Gatekeeper knew the difference and showed the evidence.

Gatekeeper is a local-first repository intelligence and governance agent for Codex. It is designed to help Codex judge whether a change belongs in a project—not only whether the changed code is locally correct—by combining deterministic policy with durable, traceable project memory.

## Current status

Phase 0 establishes the strict TypeScript workspace, review and policy contracts, verdict invariant, Doctor command, CI, and security/architecture documentation. It intentionally does **not** review diffs, run a server, store data, call GitHub, expose MCP tools, or render a dashboard yet.

## Quick start

Requirements: Node.js 24 LTS and pnpm 11.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
pnpm --filter @gatekeeper/cli start -- --help
pnpm --filter @gatekeeper/cli start -- doctor --format json
```

`gh` is optional in Phase 0. Doctor reports its absence as a warning and does not authenticate or make network calls.

## Foundation

- `packages/domain`: pure IDs, review entities, and deterministic verdict rules.
- `packages/contracts`: strict Zod contracts and generated JSON Schema.
- `packages/config`: policy parsing and app-data path resolution.
- `packages/testkit`: deterministic fixtures shared by tests.
- `apps/cli`: `--version`, `--help`, and `doctor` only.

The canonical verdict JSON Schema is [schemas/verdict.schema.json](schemas/verdict.schema.json), generated from the Zod contract and checked for drift by tests. The canonical policy example is [gatekeeper.policy.example.yaml](gatekeeper.policy.example.yaml).

The complete specification is the long-term product authority. The Build Week plan controls the hackathon execution order and stop gates.

## Privacy and trust

Gatekeeper is local-first, read-only by default, and treats repository/GitHub content as untrusted data. Model inference can never produce `BLOCK`; that verdict requires a hard deterministic policy finding. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
